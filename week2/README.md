# Week2 Notes

## Notes From The Material (PhD Student Thesis):

- Air pollution problem is concern for human health
- Monitoring air quality in cities is a challenge
- Current available solutions: chemiresistive organic sensors particularly nanofiber-based technologies.
- Student designed and validated a wide range resistive sensor interface to monitor highly resistive (50 + GW) sensors such as nanofibers.
- #1. Student introduced "a fully-integrated resistance-to-digital interface with on-board autonomous calibration and range selection to improve dynamic 
range and measurement error.
- #2. Student introduced
